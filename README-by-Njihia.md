This theme is an extension of Bootstrap 7.x-3.13 theme.

When I was working on geek label, I thought it needed one region content only since it's a one-page site with few content. Classes for these were fullpage-sec-lead,fullpage-sec-grey and fullpage-sec-white. 

I used bootstrap grid to center content, specifically col-md-xx-offset and some absolute positioning for content blocks. 

To create scroll effect, I used some tiny custom script in custom.js file. The carousel in clients section uses Owl carousel.
